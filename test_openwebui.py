End-to-End Playwright Test for Open WebUI RAG Functionality

This script uses Playwright to automate browser interaction and verify the complete
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It ensures that the frontend (Open WebUI)
can correctly communicate with the backend (LangServe API) and display the expected
response from the RAG chain.
