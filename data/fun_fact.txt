Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a super popular American book series and media franchise. It was created by author and cartoonist Jeff Kinney. The series is all about Greg Heffley, a middle school student. He writes and draws about his daily life in a diary (even though he calls it a journal!).

Jeff Kinney worked on the first book for eight years before showing it to a publisher. In 2004, a website called Funbrain and Kinney put out an online version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. This website shared new entries every day from September 2004 to June 2005. By 2009, the online version had been seen almost 20 million times! Many readers really wanted a printed book.

In February 2006, at the New York Comic Con, Kinney signed a deal with Abrams Books. This deal was to turn Diary of a Wimpy Kid into a printed book series. The first book came out in April 2007 and was an instant hit. In April 2009, Time magazine even named Kinney one of the 100 most influential people.

The series has nineteen main books and an activity book. There's also a spin-off series about Greg's best friend, Rowley Jefferson, which has three books. 20th Century Studios made live-action movies based on the books from 2010 to 2017. Later, three animated movies came out in the early 2020s.

Since the online version first appeared, most of the books have gotten great reviews and sold tons of copies. By 2020, over 250 million copies had been sold worldwide. This makes it the fourth best-selling book series ever!
