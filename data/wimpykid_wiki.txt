Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an American illustrated children's novel series and media franchise created by author and cartoonist Jeff Kinney.[1][2] The series follows Greg Heffley, a middle-schooler who illustrates his daily life in a diary (although he insists that it is a journal).[3]

The first cover of the book was designed in 1998. Kinney spent eight years working on the first book before showing it to a publisher.[4] In 2004, Funbrain and Kinney released an online version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The website made daily entries from September 2004 to June 2005.[5] The online version had received almost 20 million views by 2009. Nonetheless, many online readers requested a printed version. In February 2006, during the New York Comic Con, Kinney signed a multi-book deal with publisher Abrams Books to turn Diary of a Wimpy Kid into a printed book series.[4] The first installment was released in April 2007[5] and received immediate success. In April 2009, Time magazine named Kinney in the Time 100 most influential people.[6]

As of October 2024, the series consists of nineteen main entries, as well as an activity book. A spin-off series centering on the character Rowley Jefferson has three installments as of 2021.[7] 20th Century Studios produced a live-action film series of the same name from 2010 to 2017, and three animated films in the early 2020s.[8]

Since the release of the online version, most of the books have garnered positive reviews and commercial success. As of 2020, more than 250 million copies have been sold globally, making it the fourth best-selling book series of all time.[9]

Films

Live-action films
Jeff Kinney announced that, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, a film based on the first book would be produced by 20th Century Fox. The film was released on March 19, 2010, moved up from an April 2 release date.[26] It was directed by Thor Freudenthal, who also directed Hotel for Dogs. The film starred Zachary Gordon as Greg, Robert Capron as Rowley (Greg's best friend), Steve Zahn as Frank (Greg's father), Rachael Harris as Susan (Greg's mother), Devon Bostick as Rodrick (Greg's older brother), Connor and Owen Fielding as Manny (Greg's younger brother), Chloë Grace Moretz as a new character named Angie, and Grayson Russell as Fregley.[8][27]

The second film in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, was released on March 25, 2011,[28] was based on the second book Rodrick Rules, with Zachary Gordon reprising his role as Greg Heffley. The film also contains some elements from The Last Straw within its plot.

The third film, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days, combines the third and fourth books The Last Straw and Dog Days, taking stories from both, but mainly from Dog Days, from which it took its title. The decision to blend the two films was made to keep up with the ages of the actors. The film was released on August 3, 2012.[29]

The likelihood of a fourth live-action film was slim. Kinney has announced the possibility for an animated film to be based on Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever as the next installment. In an interview for the book Hard Luck, Jeff Kinney stated he was working with Fox on a half-hour special of Cabin Fever, which was to be aired in late 2014,[30][31] but as of 2021 no updates on the special have been announced.
